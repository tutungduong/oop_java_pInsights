## OOP - Object Oriented Programming <a name="OOP"></a>

Is a programming paradigm in which programs are organized around data, or based on the concept "objects", rather than functions and logic.

Basically an object can be defined as a data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods)

Simply put, OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Due to the organization of an object-oriented program, this method is also conducive to collaborative development where projects can be divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.

OOP was developed to increase the reusability and maintainability of source code. Transparent representation of the control flow had no priority and was meant to be handled by a compiler. With the increasing relevance of parallel hardware and multithreaded coding, developing transparent control flow becomes more important, something hard to achieve with OOP

## Principles of OOP <a name="principles-OOP"></a>

**Object Oriented Programming is based on the following principles**:

### `Encapsulation` <a name="encapsulation"></a>

The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class.

Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.

The meaning of **Encapsulation**, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

- declare class variables/attributes as `private`
- provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a `private` variable

**Get and Set**

You learned from the previous chapter that `private` variables can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has no access to it). However, it is possible to access them if we provide public **get** and **set** methods.

The `get` method returns the variable value, and the `set` method sets the value.

Syntax for both is that they start with either `get` or `set`, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case:

**Example**

```java
public class Person {
  private String name; // private = restricted access

  // Getter
  public String getName() {
    return name; // return the value of the variable name
  }

  // Setter
  public void setName(String newName) {
    this.name = newName; // The set method takes a parameter (newName) and assigns it to the name variable
  }
}

```

**Why Encapsulation?**

- Better control of class attributes and methods
- Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
- Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
- Increased security of data

### `Abstraction` <a name="abstraction"></a>

Abstract Classes and Methods

Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. This concept helps developers make changes and additions over time more easily.

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).

- **Abstract class**: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- **Abstract method**: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:

Example:

```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  public abstract void sound();
  // Regular method
  public void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

// Subclass (inherit from Animal)
class Cat extends Animal {
  public void sound() {
    // The body of sound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The cat says: Miau");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Cat myCat = new Cat(); // Create a Cat object
    myCat.animalSound();
    myCat.sleep();
  }
}
```

## Object and Classes

Exist two main concepts in OOP: Object and Classes.

#### Object:

- Instances of clases
- Instances of clases

An instance is created so you can use the methods that that class defines.

It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of:

    State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.

    Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.

    Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

#### Class

Is a template that allow to create object, containt the definition of attributes and the procedure for the class

- They are used to represent entities or concepts
- Each object created from a class is called an instance of the class
- Has methods (Performs a task)
- It has attributes, by convention they must be private
- The name must begin with a capital letter

<strong>Static class:</strong>

- No need to create instances to call them
- Only static methods can be called

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

      Modifiers : A class can be public or has default access.

      Class name: The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).

      Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.

      Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.

      Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.
